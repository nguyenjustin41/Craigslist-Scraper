How this webscraper is used:

By pairing this script with a script runner such as Windows Task Scheduler this script can be used to webscrape Craigslist postings which includes: post title, post link, and hours posted.

Because these Craigslist postings can go very quickly (esp. free item postings) this webscraper can be used as a way to notify via email address a specific searched item by title. 

This script can also be used for any other category in Craigslists.
After scraping the data main.py uses smtplib to send automated email updates to a particular item.

Conclusion:
This was a cool and creative way to get introduced to web scraping on Python as well as learn how to data websites.
