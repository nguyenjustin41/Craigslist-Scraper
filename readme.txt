By pairing this script with Windows Task Scheduler (tool to automatically run scripts) the main.py script can be used to run X hours indefinitely to scrape your desired craigslist posts.

The purpose of this web scraper is to give you the latest email updates on a particular item that you want from the Craigslist Free section. Because these listings dissapear very quickly (because its free) this webscraper will help notify you via email along with the time the post was last made. 

This was a creative way to get introduced to web scraping on python as well as learn how to mine data websites. 

This script is for educational purposes only.
